AC controller which works on a MHI-AC-Ctrl module. It is using the MQTT messages to communicate with the MHI-AC_Ctrl module.

It is based on a Wireless Tag WT32-SC01 Plus display module with an integrated ESP32.
Layout is designed with Squareline Studio. Export to the UI directory and copy files to the src directory.

I used a 3D printed case from https://www.printables.com/model/381026-wt32-sc01-plus-desk-case

Autocontrol is something private from me. So you have to remove that one.
